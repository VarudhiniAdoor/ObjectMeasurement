The Real Time Object Measurement using OpenCV
Real-time object measurement is a critical capability in various industries, including manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. This project aims to develop a real-time object measurement system using OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library. The system focuses on accurately measuring the dimensions of objects in dynamic environments, leveraging image processing and computer vision techniques.
The project employs methods such as edge detection, contour analysis, and perspective transformation to identify and measure objects in real-time. Calibration techniques, involving reference objects with known dimensions, are used to convert pixel-based measurements to real-world units, ensuring accuracy.
